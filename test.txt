This is an international disgrace. The Government should add a rider to its ratification of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child adding “does not apply to Uttar Pradesh under BJP rule.” Shameful.
As 2019 comes to a close, we're reflecting on how whistleblowers brought so much critical information to the public.
Giving your models ridiculous names like Elmo, Bert and ParseyMcParseFace is a great way to signal to the world that you are a bunch of adolescents throwing shit at a wall instead of an intellectual discipline building foundational concepts that will last centuries.
We are very lucky, and have everything we need in this era of abundance. We decided that, outside of one new set of clothes for our growing kids and groceries, we’re going to not buying any material things in 2020.
Donald Trump's ignorance on the climate change emergency is threatening the very lives of our children and future generations.
In Sen. McConnell's hometown newspaper, the majority leader was panned in a scathing op-ed criticizing him for not being “impartial” or treating impeachment with “gravity.”
Ever notice how the biggest fans of overwork are usually investors or company owners? And the primary victims of this culture are workers? If you’re in the latter group, developing a bit of class consciousness would serve you well.
Late contender for most annoying twitter trend in 2019: people telling other people they don’t know, in the industries they don’t understand, how much they should or should not “work” for “success”. 
Crafted from 20 to more than 30 ingredients, the one-of-a-kind mix is synonymous with the East Indian community—descendants of people indigenous to the North Konkan region on India’s west coast who converted to Christianity.
For many households and restaurants, using paracetamol is the fastest way to prepare meat. It saves gas, kerosene or firewood. And costs much less, N50 for one sachet of 12 tablets, and each tablet can cause... meat to cook soft within few minutes.
After lighting the lamp, told the kids this combined science& tradition: the practice is millennia old, but today the wicks are dipped in camphor to facilitate burning. The clockwise ritual mimics the sun rising in the east & the earth revolving around it: ancient Indian wisdom
In the mid-second century, the coastal town of Oea (now modern-day Tripoli in Libya) began an architectural shift to reflect its status as a Roman colony.
Hug your kids. Hug everyone you love.
you tech people need to hang out with artists and creative folks more, seriously. And they’re not mutually exclusive groups of people either. Go and watch some eyeofestival talks while you’re at it.
Imagine if there was some kind of grouping for democracies nearby that worked together on economic and security issues to defend shared interests.
Repeating the facts, over and over, is the way to be a lighthouse in the fog of misinformation and lies. Otherwise people doubt, tune out, assume the truth is unknowable, or that known facts are up for debate.
When I was a kid Malthusian projections said by now we were going to be 20 billion most without food. But we are less than 7.7 bn and more die of obesity than malnutrition. Education became the best contraceptive and the farming industry became ultra productive.
Just looked at my wiki for 1st time in years. It’s insane! Btw, can someone please delete “investor”. I do basically zero investing.
Never trust cynics, as they excuse their own bad deeds by telling themselves everyone does it
If life is a video game, the graphics are great, but the plot is confusing & the tutorial is way too long
Root of energy to mass ratio is max render speed of the simulation
Math jokes have a small audience
Hydrogen is a light, odorless gas, which, given enough time, turns into people who will make this statement
I always like going South; somehow, it feels like going downhill.
Was a lead story today as was the anti CAA protests in Mumbai and other parts. Don’t live in an echo chamber sir.
Sometimes, we are so attached to our way of life that we turn down a wonderful opportunity because we don't know what to do with it. I'm selfish, impatient and a little insecure. I make mistakes, I am out of control and at times hard to handle. 

But if you can't handle me at my worst, then you sure as hell don't deserve me at my best.
Be yourself everyone else is already taken.
Two things are infinite, the universe and human stupidity and I'm not sure about the universe.
So many books, so little time.
Be who you are and say what you feel, because those who mind don't matter, and those who matter don't mind.
A room without books is like a body without a soul.
You've gotta dance like there's nobody watching,
Love like you'll never be hurt,
Sing like there's nobody listening,
And live like it's heaven on earth.
You know you're in love when you can't fall asleep because reality is finally better than your dreams.
Be the change that you wish to see in the world.
You know you're in love when you can't fall asleep because reality is finally better than your dreams.
In three words I can sum up everything I've learned about life, it goes on.
If you want to know what a man's like, take a good look at how he treats his inferiors, not his equals.
Don’t walk in front of me, I may not follow
Don’t walk behind me, I may not lead
Walk beside me, just be my friend
No one can make you feel inferior without your consent.
If you tell the truth, you don't have to remember anything.
I've learned that people will forget what you said, people will forget what you did, but people will never forget how you made them feel.
A friend is someone who knows all about you and still loves you.
Always forgive your enemies; nothing annoys them so much.
To live is the rarest thing in the world. Most people exist, that is all.
Live as if you were to die tomorrow. Learn as if you were to live forever.
Darkness cannot drive out darkness, only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate, only love can do that.
I am so clever that sometimes I don't understand a single word of what I am saying.
Without music, life would be a mistake.
We accept the love we think we deserve.
Here's to the crazy ones. The misfits. The rebels. The troublemakers. The round pegs in the square holes. The ones who see things differently. They're not fond of rules. And they have no respect for the status quo. You can quote them, disagree with them, glorify or vilify them. About the only thing you can't do is ignore them. Because they change things. They push the human race forward. And while some may see them as the crazy ones, we see genius. Because the people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world, are the ones who do.
I believe that everything happens for a reason. People change so that you can learn to let go, things go wrong so that you appreciate them when they're right, you believe lies so you eventually learn to trust no one but yourself, and sometimes good things fall apart so better things can fall together.
Twenty years from now you will be more disappointed by the things that you didn't do than by the ones you did do. So throw off the bowlines. Sail away from the safe harbor. Catch the trade winds in your sails. Explore. Dream. Discover.
Only once in your life, I truly believe, you find someone who can completely turn your world around. You tell them things that you’ve never shared with another soul and they absorb everything you say and actually want to hear more. You share hopes for the future, dreams that will never come true, goals that were never achieved and the many disappointments life has thrown at you. When something wonderful happens, you can’t wait to tell them about it, knowing they will share in your excitement. They are not embarrassed to cry with you when you are hurting or laugh with you when you make a fool of yourself. Never do they hurt your feelings or make you feel like you are not good enough, but rather they build you up and show you the things about yourself that make you special and even beautiful. There is never any pressure, jealousy or competition but only a quiet calmness when they are around. You can be yourself and not worry about what they will think of you because they love you for who you are. The things that seem insignificant to most people such as a note, song or walk become invaluable treasures kept safe in your heart to cherish forever. Memories of your childhood come back and are so clear and vivid it’s like being young again. Colours seem brighter and more brilliant. Laughter seems part of daily life where before it was infrequent or didn’t exist at all. A phone call or two during the day helps to get you through a long day’s work and always brings a smile to your face. In their presence, there’s no need for continuous conversation, but you find you’re quite content in just having them nearby. Things that never interested you before become fascinating because you know they are important to this person who is so special to you. You think of this person on every occasion and in everything you do. Simple things bring them to mind like a pale blue sky, gentle wind or even a storm cloud on the horizon. You open your heart knowing that there’s a chance it may be broken one day and in opening your heart, you experience a love and joy that you never dreamed possible. You find that being vulnerable is the only way to allow your heart to feel true pleasure that’s so real it scares you. You find strength in knowing you have a true friend and possibly a soul mate who will remain loyal to the end. Life seems completely different, exciting and worthwhile. Your only hope and security is in knowing that they are a part of your life.
All that is gold does not glitter,
Not all those who wander are lost;
The old that is strong does not wither,
Deep roots are not reached by the frost.
From the ashes a fire shall be woken,
A light from the shadows shall spring;
Renewed shall be blade that was broken,
The crownless again shall be king.
It is our choices, Harry, that show what we truly are, far more than our abilities.
The opposite of love is not hate, it's indifference. The opposite of art is not ugliness, it's indifference. The opposite of faith is not heresy, it's indifference. And the opposite of life is not death, it's indifference.
It is not a lack of love, but a lack of friendship that makes unhappy marriages.
I love you without knowing how, or when, or from where. I love you simply, without problems or pride: I love you in this way because I do not know any other way of loving but this, in which there is no I or you, so intimate that your hand upon my chest is my hand, so intimate that when I fall asleep your eyes close.
I am enough of an artist to draw freely upon my imagination. Imagination is more important than knowledge. Knowledge is limited. Imagination encircles the world.
People are illogical, unreasonable, and self-centered.
Love them anyway.
If you do good, people will accuse you of selfish ulterior motives.
Do good anyway.
If you are successful, you will win false friends and true enemies.
Succeed anyway.
The good you do today will be forgotten tomorrow.
Do good anyway.
Honesty and frankness make you vulnerable.
Be honest and frank anyway.
The biggest men and women with the biggest ideas can be shot down by the smallest men and women with the smallest minds.
Think big anyway.
People favor underdogs but follow only top dogs.
Fight for a few underdogs anyway.
What you spend years building may be destroyed overnight.
Build anyway.
People really need help but may attack you if you do help them.
Help people anyway.
Give the world the best you have and you'll get kicked in the teeth.
Give the world the best you have anyway.
You have brains in your head. You have feet in your shoes. You can steer yourself any direction you choose. You're on your own. And you know what you know. And YOU are the one who'll decide where to go
This life is what you make it. No matter what, you're going to mess up sometimes, it's a universal truth. But the good part is you get to decide how you're going to mess it up. Girls will be your friends - they'll act like it anyway. But just remember, some come, some go. The ones that stay with you through everything - they're your true best friends. Don't let go of them. Also remember, sisters make the best friends in the world. As for lovers, well, they'll come and go too. And baby, I hate to say it, most of them - actually pretty much all of them are going to break your heart, but you can't give up because if you give up, you'll never find your soulmate. You'll never find that half who makes you whole and that goes for everything. Just because you fail once, doesn't mean you're gonna fail at everything. Keep trying, hold on, and always, always, always believe in yourself, because if you don't, then who will, sweetie? So keep your head high, keep your chin up, and most importantly, keep smiling, because life's a beautiful thing and there's so much to smile about.
Sometimes, you read a book and it fills you with this weird evangelical zeal, and you become convinced that the shattered world will never be put back together unless and until all living humans read the book.
I'm in love with you, and I'm not in the business of denying myself the simple pleasure of saying true things. I'm in love with you, and I know that love is just a shout into the void, and that oblivion is inevitable, and that we're all doomed and that there will come a day when all our labor has been returned to dust, and I know the sun will swallow the only earth we'll ever have, and I am in love with you.
If you live to be a hundred, I want to live to be a hundred minus one day so I never have to live without you.
Saying 'I notice you're a nerd' is like saying, 'Hey, I notice that you'd rather be intelligent than be stupid, that you'd rather be thoughtful than be vapid, that you believe that there are things that matter more than the arrest record of Lindsay Lohan. Why is that?' In fact, it seems to me that most contemporary insults are pretty lame. Even 'lame' is kind of lame. Saying 'You're lame' is like saying 'You walk with a limp.' Yeah, whatever, so does 50 Cent, and he's done all right for himself.
When one door of happiness closes, another opens; but often we look so long at the closed door that we do not see the one which has been opened for us.
People think a soul mate is your perfect fit, and that's what everyone wants. But a true soul mate is a mirror, the person who shows you everything that is holding you back, the person who brings you to your own attention so you can change your life.
A true soul mate is probably the most important person you'll ever meet, because they tear down your walls and smack you awake. But to live with a soul mate forever? Nah. Too painful. Soul mates, they come into your life just to reveal another layer of yourself to you, and then leave.
A soul mates purpose is to shake you up, tear apart your ego a little bit, show you your obstacles and addictions, break your heart open so new light can get in, make you so desperate and out of control that you have to transform your life, then introduce you to your spiritual master.
Some infinities are bigger than other infinities.
Love never dies a natural death. It dies because we don't know how to replenish its source. It dies of blindness and errors and betrayals. It dies of illness and wounds; it dies of weariness, of witherings, of tarnishings.
What really knocks me out is a book that, when you're all done reading it, you wish the author that wrote it was a terrific friend of yours and you could call him up on the phone whenever you felt like it. That doesn't happen much, though.
It is what you read when you don't have to that determines what you will be when you can't help it
